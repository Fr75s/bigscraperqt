# bigscraper-qt

## LaunchBox scraping tool

Bigscraper-qt is a tool you can use to scrape [the LaunchBox Games Database.](https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/) With a simple GUI, you can easily scrape metadata from a variety of systems.

If you want more information, head to the website. This README will mainly serve as information regarding the development of bigscraper-qt.

## Running from Source

To run the source code, simply clone the repository, go into its directory, and run `python3 -m bsqt`. You may optionally add the -n argument to test the flatpak version behavior.

## Building from Source

WIP

## Planned Features

A list of new planned features are below.

- Flathub Release (flatpak availability)
- "All" export system option
- Export to Secondary frontend
- More efficient folder scraping

Some of these features were in previous iterations; I hope to add them to bigscraper-qt as well:

- Asynchronous scraping (even more efficient)
- Clearing Cached data from application
